### Project overview
This application is a stopwatch which uses the React library.
The user can start, pause and clear the stopwatch.
The user can also record lap times.
Lap times are kept additionally stored in local storage, and so preserved in case the page is refreshed.

### Setting up the app
To use this application, you must have installed Node.js.
Before first use, the command `npm install` must be used on the directory.

### Running the app
Once this hads been done, `npm start` runs the app in the development mode.
Your browser should then automatically open and the app will be displayed and ready on local host port 3000. 
If this does not happen, you can manually open `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.
